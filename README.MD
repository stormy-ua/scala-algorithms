I am going to put there different algrorithms and data structure implemented in scala language.

[B-Tree](https://github.com/stormy-ua/scala-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/BTree.scala) - self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
