I am going to put here various algrorithms and data structures implemented in scala language.

[B-Tree](https://github.com/stormy-ua/scala-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/BTree.scala) - self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

[Merge Sort](https://github.com/stormy-ua/scala-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/MergeSort.scala) - popular sorting algorithm with the running time O(nlog(n))

[Binary Tree](https://github.com/stormy-ua/scala-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/BinaryTrees.scala) - algorithms on binary [search] trees
